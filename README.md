# SVG Flags

A place to practice SVG by drawing flags of places I've been. SVG elements are drawn inline with HTML index files for ease of access with JS. Flags include: 

* USA
* Botswana x
* Finland x
* Iceland x
* Laos x
* Norway x
* Sweden x
* Thailand x
* Zimbabwe x

An x following the country name indicates that the flag is incomplete.
